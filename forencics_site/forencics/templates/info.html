                2023</a>, where he and his team had
              to
              develop a system that could
              help the police with video camera crimes. The project was fully realised and was able to recognise people,
              faces, weapons, shooting sounds and make a 3d model of the crime scene using data from cameras.
            </p>

            <p>In 2023,
              Dmytro helped with the organisation of the summer school in mathematics and computer science <a
                class="usuala" href="https://summerschool.lol">LOL-2023</a>. He
              helped with teaching, organising teaching materials and computer science tasks for students of grades
              7-11.</p>

            <p>After Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine, Dmytro remained in Kharkiv and was engaged in

            <p> After graduating from lyceum Dmytro continues his education in one of the
              prestigious universities in Kharkiv, where he is studying mathematics and programming. Now as a student,
              the he participates in programming contests such as <a class="usuala" href="https://ugp.in.ua">Grand Prix
                of Ukraine</a>

              to
              help the police detect and investigate crimes. Both projects were finished and were able to identify the
              most problematic areas and to recognise people, faces, weapons, shooting sounds and make a 3d model of
              the
              crime scene using data from cameras.</p>

            <p>In 2023, Oleksii as a volunteer helped with the organisation of the summer school in mathematics and
              computer science <a class="usuala" href="https://summerschool.lol">LOL-2023</a>. He helped with the
              organisation of the Quest - an entertaining event of the
              summer school and IT infrastructure accompanying it.</p>
